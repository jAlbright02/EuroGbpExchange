# EuroGbpExchange

## What it does
This is a simple Euro to GBP exchange calculator. It uses the Java Swing framework to make the GUI in ths mini project.
It is very primitive and not finished but works.

## How to use
Run the application and enter your euro amount.
Press the 'Convert' button to change the amount into GBP.

## Issues
1. The formatting of the pounds needs to be fixed.
2. The project needs to be packaged and deployed into a .exe file/desktop application.
3. The UI requires improvement.

## API
The API I used was [Fixer.io's](https://fixer.io/).
Very easy to use, limited requests but free and great for learning.

## Disclaimer
Not intended for commercial use, the project is entirely educational for me to learn new technologies.
